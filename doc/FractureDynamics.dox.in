/*! \mainpage Isogeometric FEM fracture dynamics application

\author Knut Morten Okstad, SINTEF Digital, Trondheim

\section intro Introduction
This is a Fracture dynamics application built on top of the IFEM library.

IFEM is an object-oriented toolbox for implementing isogeometric finite element
solvers for linear and nonlinear partial differential equations.
The toolbox is developed through the ICADA project at SINTEF ICT, Trondheim.
The purpose of this code is to serve as a common base for isogeometric
PDE-simulators, using splines and NURBS as basis functions in the finite element
formulations. The toolbox contains methods for doing linear and non-linear,
stationary and dynamic time-domain analyses, as well as eigenvalue analyses.
